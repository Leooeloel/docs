## First, the firewall

For companies with external network access restrictions, you need to add a firewall whitelist before using netless related services.

Firewall port:

```ts
80
443
```

Domain whitelist:

```ts
    gateway.netless.link
    gcdngateway.netless.link
    storage.netless.link
    gcdnstorage.netless.link
    cdnroom.netless.link
    cdnroom.netless.pro
```
